        <h1>Adam's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Adam Schulman. 
            I'm an Applied Data Analytics major
            with an interest in <strong>geography</strong> 
            and <strong>data visualization</strong>. I have 
             experience with Python, ArcGIS 
            Pro, and the Adobe suite.</p> 
         <h2>Personal Info</h2>
         <p>
            Outside of work, I like to read, practice making maps, and watching as many movies as I can fit into my free time. Back home, I have some snails as pets. There names are:
            <ul>
                <li>Shelly</li>
                <li>Sandra</li>
                <li>Brutus</li>
                <li>Wexler</li>
                <li>Slimon</li>
            </ul>
