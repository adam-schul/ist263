    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Adam Schulman. 
        Iâ€™m an Applied Data Analytics major
         with an interest in geography 
         and data visualization. I have 
         experience with Python, ArcGIS 
         Pro, and the Adobe suite. Outside 
         of work, I like to read, practice
          making maps, and watching as many
           movies as I can fit into my free
            time.
