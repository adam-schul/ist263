                <p>The field of geographic information sciences is consistently growing in importance and impact as
businesses realize that to grow financially they need to understand how to grow spatially. Many
government organizations use GIS, from the Census Bureau to the National Park Service.
The Census Bureau might use digital heat maps to locate clusters of non-respondents and efficiently send
employees to follow up. </p>

                <p>The National Park Service might use GIS to monitor water systems and land use permits.
                    Real estate developers could analyze the risk of flooding to plots of land theyâ€™re considering buying.
                    Scientist can use satellite imagery to see the change over time, determining the effects of climate change
                    manifesting in the shrinking of the polar ice caps.
                    Overall, the study of geospatial relationships is applicable everywhere and will never go away</p>
