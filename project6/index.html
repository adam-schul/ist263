                <p><strong>The Title</strong> – Reading the title is obviously a key part of understanding a map, but too often it’s overlooked
                    when glancing at a page of new geographic information. The title will give you insight into the underlying
                    purpose of the map’s creation and which information will be emphasized.</p>

                    <p><strong>Compass</strong>  – Even if the author is confident the reader will know which way is up, including a directional
                        reference is customary. These designs can range from an elegant compass rose to a simple north arrow.

                <div id="scale">
                    <p><strong>The Scale Bar</strong> – On maps that show a smaller area, the scale bar becomes very important to be able to tell
                        how large certain features on the map are. A scale shows the relationship between the distance on a map
                        and the distance on Earth. Without a scale, the reader can become disoriented. The size of land features in
                        an unknown region is almost impossible to discern without a scale. </p>

                    in the map and what they represent.</p></div>

                    latitude and longitude, respectively. These allow you to record locations of specific spots along the Earth’s
                    surface.</p></div>
