                <p>Despite not always looking like today’s technologically advanced maps, the art and science of
                    mapmaking is more than 5,000 years old. Early maps mostly focused on small areas such as trading routes,
                    cities, military plans, or hunting areas. These maps were also less frequently oriented with north at the
                    top. Both of these traits are the result of people not traveling very far outside of their home region and not
                    being aware of the planet as a whole. A world map would be of little use to a wheat farmer in
                    Mesopotamia. Maps from this time period include Egyptian maps to record property boundaries,
                    Babylonian sketches on tablets, and silk maps from China.</p>

                <p>One of the next biggest turning points in cartographic history (cartography being the practice of
                    making maps) was a collection of maps constructed by geographer Claudius Ptolemaeus of Roman Egypt in
                    150 A.D. The paper featured a collection of maps from regions all over the world. The lines of latitude and
                    longitude he included “revolutionized European geographic thinking, by imposing mathematical rules to
                    the composition of maps”

                <p>In the middle ages, the majority of progress in the field of cartography was made in the Islamic
                    world. An Arab scholar in the court of Sicily made a ton of maps and geographic books. His work was
                    incredibly impactful, his designs influencing Islamic map makers for years to come.</p>

                <p>In the European Renaissance, a few key factors dramatically shifted the map making landscape.
                    The combination of a growing public interest in learning and the invention of the printing press, which
                    removed map making from the domination of religious organizations, democratized the field and allowed
                    for greater access. (History of Mapping 2022.)
