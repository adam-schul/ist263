                        when glancing at a page of new geographic information. The title will give you insight into the underlying
                        purpose of the map’s creation and which information will be emphasized.</p>

                            reference is customary. These designs can range from an elegant compass rose to a simple north arrow.

                        <p class="content"><strong>The Scale Bar</strong> – On maps that show a smaller area, the scale bar becomes very important to be able to tell
                            how large certain features on the map are. A scale shows the relationship between the distance on a map
                            and the distance on Earth. Without a scale, the reader can become disoriented. The size of land features in
                            an unknown region is almost impossible to discern without a scale. </p>

                        surface.</p></div>
